   abstract = {To mitigate global warming and energy shortage, integration of renewable energy generation sources, energy storage systems, and plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) have been introduced in recent years. The application of electric vehicles (EV) in the smart grid has shown a significant option to reduce carbon emission. However, due to the limited battery capacity, managing the charging and discharging process of EV as a distributed power supply is a challenging task. Moreover, the unpredictable nature of renewable energy generation, uncertainties of plug-in electric vehicles associated parameters, energy prices, and the time-varying load create new challenges for the researchers and industries to maintain a stable operation of the power system. The EV battery charging management system plays a main role in coordinating the charging and discharging mechanism to efficiently realize a secure, efficient, and reliable power system. More recently, there has been an increasing interest in data-driven approaches in EV charging modeling. Consequently, researchers are looking to deploy model-free approaches for solving the EV charging management with uncertainties. Among many existing model-free approaches, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been widely used for EV charging management. Unlike other machine learning approaches, the RL technique is based on maximizing the cumulative reward. This article reviews the existing literature related to the RL-based framework, objectives, and architecture for the charging coordination strategies of electric vehicles in the power systems. In addition, the review paper presents a detailed comparative analysis of the techniques used for achieving different charging coordination objectives while satisfying multiple constraints. This article also focuses on the application of RL in EV coordination for research and development of the cutting-edge optimized energy management system (EMS), which are applicable for EV charging.},

As the market of EVs grows, new challenges to the electric grid are emerging to accommodate the EVs demand, especially in the distribution networks. In this paper, we investigate the impact of EVs deployment on the electricity demand and distributed network. We propose a model to generate EV demand profiles that consider the EV users’ driving pattern such as daily energy consumption and charging schedule, in addition to the EV’s charging characteristics. The EV demand model uses data we obtained from a survey to evaluate the model’s parameters. We use the EV demand model to simulate and evaluate the impact of EVs demand on the distribution network. We present a case study with an actual model for a distribution network to evaluate the impact of EVs on the distribution network in Saudi Arabia.

   abstract = {The electric vehicle (EV) and electric vehicle charging station (EVCS) have been widely deployed with the development of large-scale transportation electrifications. However, since charging behaviors of EVs show large uncertainties, the forecasting of EVCS charging power is non-trivial. This paper tackles this issue by proposing a reinforcement learning assisted deep learning framework for the probabilistic EVCS charging power forecasting to capture its uncertainties. Since the EVCS charging power data are not standard time-series data like electricity load, they are first converted to the time-series format. On this basis, one of the most popular deep learning models, the long short-term memory (LSTM) is used and trained to obtain the point forecast of EVCS charging power. To further capture the forecast uncertainty, a Markov decision process (MDP) is employed to model the change of LSTM cell states, which is solved by our proposed adaptive exploration proximal policy optimization (AePPO) algorithm based on reinforcement learning. Finally, experiments are carried out on the real EVCSs charging data from Caltech, and Jet Propulsion Laboratory, USA, respectively. The results and comparative analysis verify the effectiveness and outperformance of our proposed framework.},

In order to improve the accuracy and stability of short-term load forecasting for electric vehicle charging stations, an innovative prediction model based on a convolutional neural network and lion algorithm, improved by niche immunity, is proposed. Firstly, niche immunity is utilized to restrict over duplication of similar individuals, so as to ensure population diversity of lion algorithm, which improves the optimization performance of the lion algorithm significantly. The lion algorithm is then employed to search the optimal weights and thresholds of the convolutional neural network. Finally, a proposed short-term load forecasting method is established. After analyzing the load characteristics of the electric vehicle charging station, two cases in different locations and different months are selected to validate the proposed model. The results indicate that the new hybrid proposed model offers better accuracy, robustness, and generality in short-term load forecasting for electric vehicle charging stations.},

   abstract = {Electric vehicles (EV) are an emerging mode of transportation that has the potential to reshape the transportation sector by significantly reducing carbon emissions thereby promoting a cleaner environment and pushing the boundaries of climate progress. Nevertheless, there remain significant hurdles to the widespread adoption of electric vehicles in the United States ranging from the high cost of EVs to the inequitable placement of EV charging stations (EVCS). A deeper understanding of the underlying complex interactions of social, economic, and demographic factors which may lead to such emerging disparities in EVCS placements is, therefore, necessary to mitigate accessibility issues and improve EV usage among people of all ages and abilities. In this study, we develop a machine learning framework to examine spatial disparities in EVCS placements by using a predictive approach. We first identify the essential socioeconomic factors that may contribute to spatial disparities in EVCS access. Second, using these factors along with ground truth data from existing EVCS placements we predict future ECVS density at multiple spatial scales using machine learning algorithms and compare their predictive accuracy to identify the most optimal spatial resolution for our predictions. Finally, we compare the most accurately predicted EVCS placement density with a spatial inequity indicator to quantify how equitably these placements would be for Orange County, California. Our method achieved the highest predictive accuracy (94.9%) of EVCS placement density at a spatial resolution of 3 km using Random Forests. Our results indicate that a total of 11.04% of predicted EVCS placements in Orange County will lie within a high spatial inequity zone – indicating populations with the lowest accessibility may require the greater investments in EVCS placements. 69.52% of the study area experience moderate accessibility issues and the remaining 19.11% face least accessibility issues w.r.t EV charging stations. Within least accessible areas, 7.8% of the area will require low density of predicted EVCS placements, 3.4% will require a medium density of predicted EVCS placements, and 0.55% will require high density of EVCS placements. The moderately accessible areas would require the highest placements of EVCS but mostly with low density placements covering 54.42% of the area. The findings from this study highlight a generalizable framework to quantify inequities in EVCS placements that will enable policymakers to identify underserved communities and facilitate targeted infrastructure investments for widespread EV usage and adoption for all.

   abstract = {As a key pillar of smart transportation in smart city applications, electric vehicles (EVs) are becoming increasingly popular for their contribution in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. One of the key challenges, however, is the strain on power grid infrastructure that comes with large-scale EV deployment. The solution to this lies in utilization of smart scheduling algorithms to manage the growing public charging demand. Using data-driven tools and machine learning algorithms to learn the EV charging behavior can improve scheduling algorithms. Researchers have focused on using historical charging data for predictions of behavior such as departure time and energy needs. However, variables such as weather, traffic, and nearby events, which have been neglected to a large extent, can perhaps add meaningful representations, and provide better predictions. Therefore, in this paper we propose the usage of historical charging data in conjunction with weather, traffic, and events data to predict EV session duration and energy consumption using popular machine learning algorithms including random forest, SVM, XGBoost and deep neural networks. The best predictive performance is achieved by an ensemble learning model, with SMAPE scores of 9.9% and 11.6% for session duration and energy consumptions, respectively, which improves upon the existing works in the literature. In both predictions, we demonstrate a significant improvement compared to previous work on the same dataset and we highlight the importance of traffic and weather information for charging behavior predictions.},

The results revealed that the XGBoost model achieved the highest accuracy compared to the other ML classifiers in predicting charging station choice behavior. Furthermore, this study employed the newly developed SHAP approach to identify feature importance and the complex nonlinear and interactive effects of various attributes on charging station choice behavior.
